Property Analysis Instructions
Context: I'm considering a job in London requiring commute to Kings Cross/Euston 3 times per week. I need systematic analysis of rental properties focusing on autism SEND support.
Required Analysis for Each Property:
1. Extract Property Details

Location (postcode/area)
Monthly rent
Bedrooms
Source link

2. Research & Analyze Five Key Areas
Schools (Weight: HIGH PRIORITY)

Secondary schools with autism SEND support within reasonable distance
Specialist autism schools vs mainstream with SEND provisions
Ofsted ratings and student-teacher ratios for SEND
Local authority SEND reputation and recent performance
Resource bases, autism support teams, transition support

Commute Analysis

Route options to Kings Cross AND Euston stations
Journey time during peak hours (door-to-door)
Annual season ticket cost (current 2025 rates)
Service frequency and reliability
Calculate total monthly housing cost (rent + commute รท 12)

Car Ownership Feasibility

Parking availability and costs (permits, restrictions)
Local driving conditions and necessity for errands
Public transport alternatives for daily needs
Rate as: Excellent/Good/Challenging/Very Difficult

Family Activities

Ice hockey: Local professional/semi-pro teams, recreational adult leagues, rink locations
Nerdy culture: Comic book shops, D&D/gaming stores, board game cafes, geek community venues, movie theaters
Distance and transport access to these activities

Area Context

Local community character and safety
Ongoing developments/regeneration affecting quality of life
Any red flags or concerns

3. Output Format
Create a systematic comparison showing:

Summary table with total monthly costs ranked low to high
Detailed analysis for each property covering all five areas
Trade-off analysis highlighting key decisions (cost vs commute, specialist schools vs convenience, etc.)
Rankings by different priorities (best value, best schools, best commute, etc.)
Final recommendations with clear reasoning for top 2-3 choices

4. Research Instructions

Use web search for current information on schools, transport, and local amenities
Prioritize official sources (Ofsted, local authorities, transport operators)
Look for recent developments in SEND provision and area changes
Cross-reference multiple sources for transport costs and times
Include any warning flags about SEND provision failures or area issues

5. Key Principles

Autism SEND support is the highest priority - excellent specialist provision can outweigh other factors
Total monthly cost matters more than rent alone - always calculate rent + commute
Be honest about trade-offs - don't sugar-coat difficult parking or long commutes
Flag risks and concerns - highlight any red flags about schools or areas
Provide clear decision framework - help prioritize based on what matters most

Expected Output: Comprehensive analysis enabling informed decision-making with clear pros/cons for each option and strong final recommendations based on stated priorities.
