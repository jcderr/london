## Research Framework

### 1. SECONDARY SCHOOL ACCESS (Priority #1)

**Objective:** Assess realistic prospects for mid-year Year 7 admission with autism support considerations.

**Research Steps:**

a) **Distance Mapping**

- Calculate straight-line distance from property to nearest 5-8 secondary schools
- Identify schools within 3-mile radius (realistic daily travel distance)
- Note walking time vs. transport requirements

b) **Catchment Verification**

- Determine if property falls within designated catchment for any secondary schools
- Research local authority’s catchment boundaries (maps on council websites)
- Note if area operates selective (grammar) vs. comprehensive system

c) **School Quality Assessment**

- Ofsted ratings (Outstanding/Good/Requires Improvement/Inadequate)
- Recent inspection dates and key findings
- Academic results (GCSE Grade 5+ in English & Maths)
- Overall capacity and oversubscription status

d) **SEND/Autism Provision** (CRITICAL)

- Identify schools with dedicated Autism Resource Provisions (ARPs) or specialist units
- Check for SEND support infrastructure (SENCo teams, specialist TAs, autism-trained staff)
- Note whether ARP access requires EHCP or is available through mainstream admissions
- Research local authority’s SEND services and EHCP processing times

e) **Mid-Year Admission Reality Check**

- Recent admission data: furthest distance offered, applications-to-places ratio
- Contact schools if possible to verify Year 7 capacity for January 2026
- Assess whether catchment status guarantees placement or merely provides priority
- Note if school is expanding, declining, or at stable capacity

**Output Format:**

|School|Distance |Ofsted  |Catchment|SEND Provision       |Mid-Year Prospect              |
|------|---------|--------|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
|[Name]|[X miles]|[Rating]|Yes/No   |[ARP/Mainstream/None]|Highly Likely/Moderate/Unlikely|

**Analysis:** State clearly which school(s) offer the most realistic pathway for mid-year admission, noting whether autism specialist provision is accessible or requires EHCP processes.

-----

### 2. PRIMARY SCHOOL OPTIONS (Priority #2)

**Objective:** Identify viable Year 5 mid-year entry options leading to stable Year 6 completion.

**Research Steps:**

a) **Proximity Survey**

- List all primary schools within 1.5-mile radius
- Note walking distance vs. transport requirements
- Identify schools serving appropriate age ranges (some are infant-only or junior-only)

b) **Catchment Identification**

- Determine designated catchment school for the postcode
- Verify catchment boundaries on local authority maps
- Note if catchment provides guaranteed or priority admission

c) **School Quality**

- Ofsted ratings with inspection dates
- Key Stage 2 results if available
- School size and capacity indicators
- Oversubscription history

d) **Mid-Year Feasibility**

- Check school websites for stated in-year admission policies
- Note if schools are at capacity or have known waiting lists
- Larger schools (2+ forms of entry) generally have more flexibility

**Note:** SEND provision research NOT required for primary schools unless specific concerns arise.

**Output Format:**

|School|Distance |Ofsted  |Ages Served |Catchment|Mid-Year Prospect|
|------|---------|--------|------------|---------|-----------------|
|[Name]|[X miles]|[Rating]|[4-11, etc.]|Yes/No   |Good/Moderate/Low|

**Analysis:** Recommend 1-2 primary schools with strongest prospects, noting catchment advantages and capacity indicators.

### 3. NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY & DEMOGRAPHICS

**Research Steps:**

a) **Crime Statistics**

- Use [police.uk](http://police.uk) to search postcode - review last 12 months
- Calculate crimes per 1,000 residents (if population data available)
- Compare to city/county average
- Breakdown by type: violence, burglary, vehicle crime, ASB
- Identify trends: increasing, stable, or decreasing

b) **Demographics (if accessible)**

- Census data for postcode district or ward
- Average age, household composition, ethnic diversity
- Deprivation indices (Index of Multiple Deprivation)
- Home ownership vs. rental ratios

c) **Family Infrastructure**

- Parks and playgrounds within 1km
- Youth facilities, sports centers, libraries
- Community centers or family support services
- Special provision: inclusive playgrounds, autism-friendly venues

**Output Format:**

**Crime Rate:** [X per 1,000 residents] - [X%] higher/lower than [area] average  
**Trend:** Increasing/Stable/Decreasing  
**Safety Assessment:** [1 paragraph summary]  
**Family-Friendliness:** [High/Medium/Low] - [Brief justification with 2-3 key facilities]

## Special Considerations

**Autism Support Research:**

- Prioritize schools with dedicated ARPs or well-resourced SEND departments
- Check local authority SEND support quality and EHCP processing
- Identify autism-friendly community facilities (sensory-friendly cinema, inclusive playgrounds)
- Note availability of autism support groups and services

**Mid-Year Admission Timing:**

- January/February 2026 is challenging period (post-September intake, typically full)
- Emphasize schools with known capacity, recent expansions, or undersubscription
- Recommend contacting schools directly to verify real-time Year 7/Year 5 availability
- Suggest backup strategies (accepting allocated school + waiting lists)

**EHCP Considerations:**

- If family has existing EHCP: explain specialist placement processes differ from standard admissions
- If EHCP needed: outline assessment timeline (typically 20 weeks) and implications for January move
- Identify which specialist provisions require EHCP vs. accessible through mainstream routes
